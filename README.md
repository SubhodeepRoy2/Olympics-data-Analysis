# Olympics-data-Analysis
Imagine a giant box filled with information about the Tokyo Olympics! This information includes details about athletes, coaches, teams, and even the medals
awarded.
This project is about building a special tool that can quickly sort through all this information and answer
interesting questions. Think of it like a super- powered search engine, but for the Tokyo Olympics!

Here are some of the things this tool can help us discover:
• How many athletes participated from each country?
• Which countries won the most medals?
• How many female athletes participated in each sport?

By using this tool, we can learn a lot about the Tokyo Olympics and how different countries performed!
